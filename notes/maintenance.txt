Account maintenance (Via validation mid transaction)

The benfit to this method is that it will be a lot easier to process maintenence on accounts on an "as needed" basis,
rather than trying to have the nodes generate crazy distribute transactions possibly touching hundreds or thousands of accounts
all at once.

On user generated transactions like "message" or "transfer", somewhere within the validation stage, needs to be some kind
of check to ensure the account maintenance has been processed in the last *account maintenance interval*
ELSE process the account maintenance, and add a last maintenance flag.

The problem with this approach is that now we need to add checks for this on every transaction type. It's not really much
of a performance issue as much, but it is a bit annoying. Maybe just the transactions that effect a user's balance
should be checked (and processed if need be).

This creates the (hassle / design desision) of informing the user that additional funds are needed to perform this
transaction because of the required account maintenance. Also, if the user hasn't made any transactions recenty,
(say within a week or two) then they would need a deduction of about 7-14x of what the account maintenance fee would entail
(given that the maintenance interval was daily).
Implementation writeup:

1. User accounts need a field for "lastMaintenance"
2. transactions involved in deducting a user's balance require a helper function to check whether maintenance is required
  - register
  - transfer
  - distribute
  - message
  - toll
  - friend
  - stake
  - proposal
  - dev_proposal
  - vote
  - dev_vote
3. this helper method will trigger in the validation of these transactions, and determine the
   amount needed for deducting based on when the last maintenance was performed.
4. This amount will be passed through to the apply, so that all nodes know about the additional
   amount needed to deduct.
5. Decide on one of the following design choices:
  - Warn the user about the maintenance deduction (if it's about to occur)
  - Only warn the user if the amount being deducted plus the amount sent with the tx will overdraw account balance
  - Deduct maintenence fee without warning, and only notify user that the transaction failed due to insufficient funds (*)
